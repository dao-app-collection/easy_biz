# Easy-Biz

**In-Progress** app meant to help organize my freelance work.

- Nested to-do's (ie. can have many sub-tasks for one to-do)
- To-do's are assigned to a deadline, given an estimated time to completion
- Estimates generated based on ttl hours in all to-do's associated with a project
- Track time for hourly projects
- Generate invoices
